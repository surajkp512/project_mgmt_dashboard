# 🧭 Project Management Dashboard

This repository is my **central dashboard** for all my personal projects – from tiny experiments to bigger apps.  
As I build more things, I’ll list, categorize, and track them here.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Keep track of all my projects in one place  
- Show what I’m currently learning & working on  
- Make it easy for others (and future me 😄) to explore my work

## 📂 Project Portfolio

| # | Project Name | Tech Stack | Status | Link |

| 2 | Another Project | Python, Django | ✅ Completed | [Repo](https://github.com/surajkp512) |

> I’ll keep updating this table as I create more projects.

## 🛠️ Planned Features for This Dashboard

- [ ] A small web UI to view all my projects  
- [ ] Filters by status (Completed / In Progress / Idea)  
- [ ] Tags for tech stack (React, Django, etc.)  
- [ ] Deployed version (GitHub Pages / Vercel / Netlify)

---

## 📎 Tech Stack (Planned)

- Frontend: React (maybe Vite)  
- Backend / API: Django or Node (optional)  
- Hosting: GitHub Pages (for static dashboard)

## ✅ Current Status

Right now this repo is mainly a **planning + documentation space**.  
Code and UI will be added as I build out the dashboard.

Stay tuned 🙂
